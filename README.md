# Visualization\_Tuesdays
Just like Taco Tuesdays, this will be a weekly series for me to work on various Explatory Data Analysis projects, from a wide range of data sources. Most likely from kaggle, or from my previous projects.

## The Goal:
My personal goal is to develop stronger data communication skills. With my work, **I want to be able to tell a story from the data**. This includes:
* Data Visualization
* Data Manipulation/cleaning
* Communication Skills

I will mainly be using python as my go to tool. However, I would like to slowly incorporate some other types of technologies and languages such as R.
