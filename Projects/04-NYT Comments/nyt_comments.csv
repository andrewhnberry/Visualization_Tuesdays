Whether it is Amy Cooper, Jussie Smollett, riots where people attacks innocents to prove another point, all it shows is that the accusers are flawed, that victimhood is a very problematic position, fraught with unfair aggression. How quickly victims turn to perpetrators today is probably due to how the position is celebrated in media. No wonder. Victimhood allows you to spit in the face of others without consequences - it is the most entitled and privileged position there is today. What happens to a society when it only celebrates weakness? It is the beginning of the end. The downfall of true morality and individual happiness and trust. Because you cannot trust the person who solves life by accusing, not through overcoming and giving. People of color are becoming incredibly racist in the USA. I have read books about race presented with such bias that they made me imagine that this is how Mein Kampf was written, Hitler’s statement of victimhood and moral superiority. The racist always feels morally superior. When the thesis of much of this literature and its reachers are based on the premise that their skin color makes them morally superior, then we must take heed.

They have assisted Trump while he has torn the country apart, lied to the public repeatedly, extorted allies, and drove the NATO alliance to the brink. Pompeo, Esper and the rest have actively supported obstructing Congressional subpoenas from the State Department which covers up for the president’s malfeasance, defied Congressional orders for weapon sales to Saudi Arabia and abused and misused the office of the Secretary of State and the Department of Defense.

They are intentionally diverting attention from long histories of police crimes targeting African Americans, including the murder of George Floyd.  No federal intervention is proposed for these crimes.

Despite reservations, I also voted for Carter in 1976, though even by then I was concerned by the breakdown in law and order evidenced by the riots in '67 and '68, especially those close to home here in the DC area.

I voted for Reagan in 1980 after graduating from college and getting a good job, having quickly realized Democrats were primarily interested in picking my pockets, and haven't voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since (though I didn't vote for Trump; I went with Gary Johnson).

I have fairly strong libertarian leanings, and have long voiced my opinion that too many police officers suffer from an authority complex (and enter the profession only to exercise it), and have viewed police killings of certain black men with utter disgust (Philando Castile; George Floyd).

In contrast, Joe Biden spent the last days doing nothing but listening in churches to those who have suffered, and he prayed. Trump and the GOP may try to pretend that Biden is weak and demented but it's a lie.

Biden spoke in Philadelphia. Despite a speech impediment, he spoke coherently, deliberately, and with passion and outrage. He spoke about the fight for the soul of our nation; how it was a struggle for social, economic, and racial justice. 

Biden's humility, his willingness to listen, and to see himself as part of a solution was evident. He acknowledging how communities of color have had a boot on their necks, and have long been brutalized. I appreciated that he stated reform must be undertaken by all Americans if it is to succeed.

Here's where we're headed (you read it here first, months ago):
There's one solution to the disproportionate impact of the criminal justice system on Black and Brown folks. Take a cue from Obama's policy toward public schools. The number of suspects and arrests for crimes cannot exceed the proportions of the suspect's racial (need a special ethnic rule for the LatinX/Hispanic/Chicano ... etc) demographic group. The demographics would be from a nationwide level. For example, if suspect's racial demographic group makes up 15% of the US population and there are currently suspects from that demographic group either being investigated or under arrest for 15% of open cases for a type of crime then that suspect cannot be arrested or even investigated. This applies to murder, theft, driving with broken taillights, spitting on a sidewalk, you name it. The oppression ends there! This might present a challenge to database access but it can be solved.

All the students were sent to the periphery, with the Sorbonne empty for decades, used only for ceremonies. And all the romantic cobblestones in Paris were replaced by asphalt.

When I was there, the Sorbonne was still empty, but students had come to Jussieu, in central Paris. That university was surrounded by a heavy iron fence, and a push of a button had fence come from the ground to close all the entrances.

As a young boy in eastern Poland, my father witnessed the Soviet army march into his town in 1939.  Two years later, he witnessed the German army invade from the west.  Decades later he painfully recounted the show of brute force, mechanization, and intimidation both armies brought with them as they occupied the streets of Korets, Poland.   

My father came to the United States in 1951 seeking an escape from the totalitarianism and war that haunted him in his youth.  He loved this country and the opportunity to live without tryanny.  Dad cherished America's values of freedom, justice, and equality.

Last night I watched a line of mounted U.S. Park Police, shielded Military Police and National Guard marching on a crowd of peaceful protesters in front of the White House.  They were firing flash grenades, rubber bullets, and tear gas on the crowd.

Trump's volatile words followed by the actions of our military and law enforcement echoed my father's memories of 1939 and 1941.   It was horrifying to watch.

But we are at this juncture because there has been a narrative creating the impression that police misconduct resulting in deaths is widespread, and if the misconduct involves a white police officer and a black victim, then the reason must be because of race.

No surprise here. It’s Trumps modus operandi, no empathy, no compassion, just hollow words to feign support or empathy. No attempt to unite America but rather bring out the big stick, threaten and sue protesters into submission while making example of others.

Real Americans are sick tired and frustrated as words of condolences, of expressions of horror prove insincere as time and time again nothing changes for the better. Trump says it’s terrorism what happening while taking not responsibility nor healing actions for the terror black Americans suffer via racism everyday.

The American economy was on an upward trajectory when Trump took office, but apart from looking after his freinds he has squandered opportunities, trashed governance, egocentricity lied constantly, with no regard or apparent wisdom as to what has made America great, albeit imperfect. 

Honoring George Floyd by making amends should mean working to change America for the better, that’s why the protests are spreading because many Americans have little faith in that as appalled as Trump would like us to believe he is, he will be quick to move on to “business as usual” and the protests will have been in vain.

I've seen videos of protesters standing or sitting still with their hands up, lying face down in the street,  walking calmy on roads or sidewalks, or standing on front porches in their neightbourhoods ---only to be bowled over by police and thrown against concrete or metal, pepper-sprayed in the face, kicked, fired at with rubber bullets, tear-gassed, beaten with cudgels. All this has been amply documented by testimonial, journalists' accounts and, more irrefutably, video.

Watching these assaults --and there is no ""fog of war"" confusion here--  it's difficult to avoid the conclusion that some police officers are simply vengeful, power-drunk or sadistic, or that these men are part of a systematic effort to discourage, through violence and intimidation, citizens from assembling (lawfully and peaceably) and journalists from reporting.

In the public interest, the NYT should be gathering evidence of unprovoked police violence and asking what if any *directives/ instructions* are given to riot police when it comes to dealing with unarmed citizens peacefully exercising their first amendment rights.

Your newspaper is seriously out of touch with reality. Multiple media outlets flat out lied when their analysts said the President was ""silent"" about the protests this weekend.

The Republican Party married the neo-confederates in the 60’s, and in doing so hitched itself to the Southern version of Christianity, which is based on the Old Testament prophets who lived with their concubines and wives in the same homes — that’s Southern plantation life. The only person who mattered in this system was the white master. Slave women were routinely raped and everyone knew the “light-skinned” children they bore were fathered by the master. White wives just had to be still and silent about it, raising sons to be just like their fathers.

During slavery, slaves and whites attended church together. This was of course to keep slaves from going behind the master’s back. But after the civil war, the two races stopped attending church together; and the newly freed slaves, though they’d learned the evangelical tradition from white Southern mostly Baptist churches, adopted a more progressive Christianity. The end of slavery meant the end of paternalistic Southern churches.

So what did white Southern churches do in response?

Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.

This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.”

A larger concern in the long run -- since we're approaching an election to which his threats and actions seem prelude -- is that once again Trump has tested the limits of his (abusive) power and won. The police obeyed him and used unnecessary force (ironically, the original cause of these protests) to disperse peaceful, lawfully-assembled protesters.

Each time they came to a line of police the marchers raised their hands chanting  ""don't shoot don't shoot.""  The police watched. I saw no effort to enforce the curfew.  

Individuals in the march who appeared to be marshals directed where the crowd walked and started the chants of ""don't shoot"" that seemed to steer the crowd away from conflict with the police.  The event appeared extremely well organized.  

The live feed ended at half past twelve, so I don't know what happened later.  But this is what a peaceful protest looks like.  It was beautiful and inspiring.

Today is Tuesday June 2, a week after the protests and civil unrest over police and racial injustice began and still the leader of our nation has failed to give a prime time national address to the nation acknowledging the pain, injustice and need for racial reconciliation and systemic reform to our broken country.

What was needed six or seven days ago was a President to go on TV and address the nation in a very human, consoling, empathetic and problem-solving way.

What we got instead was Twitter and Rose Garden threats to Americans, zero empathy, Donald hiding in the White House basement and no attempt to heal and reconcile the nation's racial wounds.

Like the coronavirus response management failure that preceded it, Trump has failed to respond to yet another major American crisis by ignoring all the clues that disaster was unfolding and failed to take any serious adult steps at acknowledging, preventing or managing this disaster.

Yet again, Trump has presided over disaster with exceptional incompetence and failure.

He needs to go.

It bothered me when, during the first eruption of looting, some people -- too many people -- were trying to dignify the thievery with specious explanations that the thieves were enacting rage against injustice. 

I've seen rage. Cackling, as the criminals on Fifth Avenue did while stealing armfuls of merchandise, isn't a symptom of rage. 

Perhaps if so many hadn't draped larceny in a mantle of legitimacy from the outset, wave after wave of these criminals wouldn't have been emboldened to use demonstrations as an excuse and an opportunity for their criminality.

I get it: peaceful marchers don't want to risk their own health by confronting thugs. But the sincere, law-abiding marchers do have a weapon at their disposal to fight back against the criminals. They have phones with cameras.

Every marcher who'd rather that these demonstrations be legitimate expressions of outrage should have phones ready to film the thieving punks the minute they start breaking glass. Then, if they're not willing to send the evidence to the local police (I wouldn't trust Trump's DOJ for a second), they should post the evidence on social media with a disclaimer like Mr. Anthony's.",8,0,[],False,0,False

He didn\'t want them in ""his"" town. All in the car were asked for ID\'s like we lived in Nazi Germany. My daughter was denigrated by this cop for not having a license and demanded why she lost it.

He was harassed another time for being a truant from school, asked to show ID, even though he had graduated years back. He had no ID and was harassed for not having a license to show as ID.
